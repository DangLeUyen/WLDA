## 1. Introduction
Weighted missing Linear Discriminant Analysis (WLDA): an algorithm can effectively handle missing data without the need for imputation methods by employing a weighted missing matrix to assess the contribution of each feature with missing values, ensuring fair treatment across features. The WLDA algorithm not only enhances the robustness and accuracy of models in the presence of missing data but also ensures that the decision-making process is transparent and comprehensible. This dual focus on data integrity and explainability is crucial for fostering trust, reliability, and broader acceptance of AI technologies in critical applications.
